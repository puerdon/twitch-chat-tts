# twitch-chat-tts

This project is used to make Twitch chat into TTS, so that while doing an IRL stream, streamer can hear the chat without reading it. It's made with tmi.js and Web Speech API.

# Features already done
- skip emote text
- skip reading a user's name if they are the last person who types in the chat

# Features to be done
- take oath as query parameter to make streamer to send messages in IRC
- make it run in the background, so the same mobile phone can be used to stream and hear chat at the same time
- detecting what language a message is to use the correspoinding voice package
